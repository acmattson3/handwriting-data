# handwriting-data
A way to gather, store, and retrieve data for the [handwriting-synthesis](https://github.com/sjvasquez/handwriting-synthesis) AI. 

## Gathering Data
The data gathering portion involves a basic OpenCV drawing program used to collect pixel data of a user's pen strokes as they write. 

The text window provides the user with a prompt to copy in writing using a digital tablet (such as a [Gaomon Tablet](https://gaomon.net/)) in the drawing window. The program records the resulting cursor events and pixel data in memory for each prompt.
